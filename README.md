# Fast Linear Algebra for Elm

This library provides fast vectors and matrices. It specifically focuses on their
application to 3D rendering with [WebGL in
Elm](https://github.com/johnpmayer/elm-webgl), but can be useful for anything
that needs to preform fast math with 4-by-4 matrices and vectors.

It is based on [the MJS library](https://code.google.com/p/webgl-mjs/) for JavaScript.
